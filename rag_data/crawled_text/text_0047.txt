After a back-and-forth contest against UC Santa Barbara, Cal State Fullerton men's basketball lost, 83-75, at Titan Gym on Saturday. The Gauchos came out the door hot with an 8-0 run, but the Titans quickly answered back and closed the gap, bringing the game within one point.After trading multi-score runs for the rest of the first half, the Gauchos led the Titans 34-29 at halftime. The second half would be much of the same: the Titans slashing into the Gauchos lead and the Gauchos creating more separation.“That’s what good teams do, they respond,” head coach Dedrique Taylor said. “They responded — shooting 65% from the floor in the second half — and we didn’t respond.”The Titans’ senior guard Zion Richardson would cap off a 7-0 run with a clutch mid-range shot to tie the game at 51-51 with 12:37 left in the contest. After exchanging buckets, Richardson would again tie up the game at 56 with a free throw, but the Titans trailed for the remainder of the game.Although Richardson was 0-for-6 from the field in the first half, scoring only two from the charity stripe, he finished the game with a double-double, recording 10 rebounds and a team-leading 16 points. UCSB senior guard Cole Anderson was a thorn in the Titan’s side, going 6-for-10 from behind the arc and totaling 29 points. Richardson has seen more and more playing time throughout the last few games, averaging 25 minutes in the last eight games, with a season high of 35 minutes against the Gauchos. He has played a big role in this team with Taylor emphasizing Richardson’s leadership ability as a communicator.“Verbally he’s doing what we ask him to do in terms of verbally leading this group and providing some offense for us,” Taylor said.Richardson's vocal leadership off the court guides the team when they fall behind.“Basketball is a game of runs, momentum’s going to shift. When something goes wrong, doesn’t go our way, I try to just get in the huddle and remind everybody that it’s okay, we’re good and just weather that storm,” Richardson said.The Titans now fall to 1-9 in conference play, ranking last in the Big West standings. They face an uphill battle to climb into the top eight teams for a chance to compete for a conference championship.“Just flush it. The past is the past, we can only worry about what’s next. Starting Monday we have to flush it, wash our wounds, like coach says. We got a big one in Hawai’i,” Richardson said.The Titans will travel to face Hawai’i at the Stan Sherriff Center in another conference game on Saturday, Feb. 1. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.
