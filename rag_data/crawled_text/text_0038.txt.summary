NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, is now traveling at 35,000 mph (56,000 kph) through interstellar space. Engineers at JPL revived its backup thrusters, which had been deemed inoperable since 2004, to ensure the spacecraft can maintain its orientation for data transmission and command reception. The thrusters were crucial to prevent the star tracker from drifting from the guide star, which could trigger an explosion if heaters failed. The mission team faced a critical deadline in May 2025, as the Earth-bound antenna would be offline for months. They successfully reactivated the thrusters, ensuring they would be available when the antenna was back online in August 2025. The test, which took 20 minutes, confirmed the thrusters were functional, saving the mission from potential failure. The success highlights the ingenuity and preparedness of NASA's engineering team.
