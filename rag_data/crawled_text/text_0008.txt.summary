The document discusses Pope Leo XIV, the first U.S.-born leader of the Catholic Church, and his dual citizenship as an American and a foreign head of state. Born in Chicago in 1955, Leo holds U.S. and Peruvian citizenship. As pope, he leads the Vatican, an independent state, and serves as the spiritual leader of 1.4 billion Catholics. The U.S. State Department notes that while Americans serving as foreign heads of state may be reviewed, they are not automatically stripped of citizenship. Law professors argue that foreign leaders should not hold U.S. citizenship if they enjoy broad immunity from U.S. laws, but the U.S. Supreme Court rules that citizens cannot be stripped of citizenship unless they intentionally renounce it. Leo has not renounced his U.S. citizenship, and Peruvian law does not conflict with his status. The document also highlights other U.S. citizens who have relinquished their citizenship while serving as foreign leaders.
