Hot off the success of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Hollywood is adapting Suzanne Collins’s new Hunger Games prequel novel, Sunrise on the Reaping, into a major motion picture. And unlike Ballad, which only had a few characters who also appeared in the Katniss Everdeen saga, this story is full of familiar names with new faces.For example, Katniss’s future mentor Haymitch Abernathy will not be played by Woody Harrelson but relative newcomer Joseph Zada. The rest of the cast, however, seems to have been dreamed up by the books biggest fans. Here’s everything we know about the movie so far (without book spoilers).What is Sunrise on the Reaping about?Sunrise on the Reaping is Haymitch Abernathy’s backstory. In the first Hunger Games book and movie, Haymitch is one of Katniss’s mentors, the only living Victor from her district. We find out that part of the reason Haymitch, an alcoholic, is so messed up is that the year he went into the arena was a Quarter Quell, which occur every 25 years, upping the stakes and leading to devastating plot twists.In Haymitch’s year, the Games demanded not two but four tributes from each district, which meant he had to watch twice as many people die. So imagine the regular Hunger Games trauma, but double it! (And no, it’s not a spoiler that he survives the games, given he’s literally alive in The Hunger Games.)When does Sunrise on the Reaping take place?It’s set during the Second Quarter Quell, a.k.a. the 50th Hunger Games, and 24 years before the events of the first Hunger Games book.Who is in the cast?Per People, Joseph Zada will star as Haymitch Abernathy, played by Woody Harrelson in the original Hunger Games movies. Meanwhile, Whitney Peak (Gossip Girl) will play his girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Most of the cast seems like it was pulled straight from TikTok edits. To start, Mckenna Grace is set to play Maysilee Donner, while Jesse Plemons is a young Plutarch Heavensbee, the enigmatic Gamemaker played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in the original films.Plemons previously played Hoffman’s son in The Master, and the two actors’ similarities and talents make Plemons, in this writer’s humble opinion, the best and only choice for the role.Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesBut what about our villain? On May 16, The Hollywood Reporter revealed Ralph Finnes will play our new President Snow, following the death of the late Donald Sutherland in June 2024. A young Coriolanus Snow was portrayed by Tom Blyth in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.“We wanted to honor Donald Sutherland by having one of this generation’s greatest actors play President Snow 24 years before Katniss Everdeen entered the arena,” producer Nina Jacobson says, per THR. “Working with Ralph has been on my bucket list since he traumatized me for life in Schindler’s List. It’s genuinely a thrill to welcome him to the Hunger Games.”Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.This is a particularly interesting casting decision as Finnes famously played the villain of another major franchise, starring as Voldemort in all of the Harry Potter films. “Voldemort and Snow ??! This is going to be the best Hunger games hands down,” one fan responded on Instagram.Then there’s Effie Trinket, originally played by Elizabeth Banks. For weeks, fans have been begging for Elle Fanning to take on the role, which became reality on May 20. “Everyone say thank you to the fandom manifesting collective. Our powers have grown stronger,” one fan commented on the announcement, while another wrote, “Naming my first born after the casting directors.” That comment received over 55,000 likes.Fans are not the only ones who believe Fanning was “born to play Effie,” as one commenter claimed. Banks also shared her approval, telling People, “I’m super excited. I texted the producers as well, and I think she’s perfect.”Banks continued, “I think everyone’s really happy. And I’m really happy about that. I’m excited for the next generation to have their Effie.”Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.If you thought fans couldn’t get anymore hyped, just wait until you learn that the games’ Master of Ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, originally played by Stanley Tucci, will now be played by Oscar-winning actor Kieran Culkin.Instagram contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Other characters who have been cast: Wyatt Callow will be played by Ben Wang, Mags Flanagan will be played by Lili Taylor, Wiress will be played by Maya Hawke, and Beetee Latier will be played by Kelvin Harrison Jr.Who else is involved?Variety reports that Francis Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer), who directed all but the first Hunger Games movie, will helm Sunrise on the Reaping.You could earn a role sin SOTR.On May 23, The Hunger Games and Lionsgate Instagram accounts posted a casting call for fans hoping to earn a role in Sunrise on the Reaping. “This is an official casting call: one lucky fan will be selected for a role in Sunrise on the Reaping,” the caption read. “To audition, show us your best: act out a scene, perform a song, or surprise us with something completely new.
