The document reports that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) closed its DEI office following an 18-month assessment. MIT also eliminated the role of the vice president for equity and inclusion, which led the department. The closure comes amid a dispute with the Trump administration, which has frozen $3 billion in research grants and contracts with Harvard. The administration accuses Harvard of discriminatory hiring and insufficient action on antisemitism, leading to a lawsuit. Harvard has also faced similar accusations from the administration and has filed a legal challenge. MIT President Sally Kornbluth emphasized the importance of attracting diverse talent and ensuring a welcoming environment. The conflict reflects broader tensions between the Trump administration and institutions that support DEI initiatives. CBS News reported on the developments, with contributions from other outlets.
