The document discusses how clownfish are shrinking their bodies to survive warmer ocean temperatures, a response observed during a heat wave in Papua New Guinea. Scientists found that 101 out of 134 clownfish shrank in length, potentially by reabsorbing bone matter, which may help them conserve energy. This adaptation, seen in both breeding pairs and other marine species, is a response to climate change and rising ocean temperatures. The study, published in *Science Advances*, highlights the resilience of marine life as they cope with environmental stressors. While the shrinking is temporary and allows clownfish to recover when conditions improve, the long-term impact of this strategy remains uncertain. The findings emphasize the need to understand and support marine ecosystems as they adapt to a warming world.
