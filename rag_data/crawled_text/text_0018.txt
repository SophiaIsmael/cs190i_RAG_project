They further cautioned that trade negotiations with dozens of countries remained in a “delicate state”, with a July 7 deadline to finalise deals fast approaching.Trump’s use of tariffs as a policy tool has elicited criticism from his opponents over unclear goals and inconsistent messaging in a vaguely defined push to restore American manufacturing.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio submitted their statements on Friday to the New York-based Court of International Trade, in response to a lawsuit filed by a coalition of small American businesses challenging US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.A three-judge panel at the court is considering whether Trump’s use of a “national emergency” was legally justified to support the tariffs.AdvertisementIf the court limited Trump’s authority, Lutnick argued, “foreign counterparts will have reduced incentives to reach meaningful agreements” and it would “destroy the carefully crafted China trade agreement, which is asymmetric in America’s favour, in order to address the emergency of our persistent goods trade deficit”.Advertisement
