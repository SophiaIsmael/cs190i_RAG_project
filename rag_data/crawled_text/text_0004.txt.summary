The document discusses former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev raising the specter of World War III as tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine escalate. Medvedev, now a top security official, responded to President Trump's criticism of Putin, warning that Russia was stoking fears of a global conflict. Trump, frustrated with the lack of a ceasefire, called Putin "crazy" after Russia launched strikes on Ukraine. Medvedev's remarks drew backlash from Trump's special envoy, who called the comments "reckless." Putin, while not directly mentioning a world war, has discussed nuclear weapons and vowed to resist Western attempts to contain Russia. The U.S. and Russia are engaged in peace talks, but progress is slow. Ukraine is facing increasing attacks, and the situation remains volatile. The document highlights the growing risk of a global conflict and the complex dynamics between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine.
