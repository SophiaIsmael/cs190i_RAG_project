night. These are Ukrainian air defence forces firing heavy machine guns into
the black sky, trying to hit a Russian drone. They miss, and seconds later, you
hear a loud roar - as if a jet is crashing down on your building. Another
second passes, and you hear an explosion outside your window, followed by a
bright flash. This scene has played out not only before my eyes but also for
tens of thousands of people in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine over the
past three nights.Since
launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russia has carried out near
nightly strikes on Ukraine. But those have intensified into powerful night-long aerial attacks in recent days. Since 23 May, it has
deployed a record number of attack drones - particularly Shahed drones - as
well as dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles.For example, on the night of 26 May, Russia launched 9
missiles and 355 drones.Ukraine claims it shot down nearly all of them. However,
there are well-founded doubts about this.First, the Russians have significantly upgraded the Shahed
drones. Previously, they were slow, flew at low altitudes, and buzzed like an
old moped. Now they are fast, roar like a jet, and can climb up to nearly 3km (1.85 miles) before striking their target. All of this is intended to make it
harder for Ukraine’s mobile fire teams to shoot them down with anti-aircraft
guns. Moreover, there is information suggesting that Shaheds can now home in on
targets without relying on satellite internet, which makes them harder to jam
using electronic warfare systems.Russia has also upgraded its ballistic missiles, according
to Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat. He says the missiles now manoeuvre as
they approach their targets and deploy decoys to evade air defence systems. As
a result, even the latest US-made Patriot systems are finding it increasingly
difficult to intercept them.These
developments come on top of Ukraine’s ongoing struggle with shortages of
foreign air defence missiles, such as those for the SAMP/T and Patriot systems. Now Kyiv must urgently work with its allies to find a way out of this difficult
situation, as there are no signs that Moscow intends to stop its aerial terror
campaign.We're now ending our live coverage but you can head to our previous post for a recap of the day.

In November, Ukraine fired UK-supplied longer-range Shadow missiles at targets in Russia."This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that."Merz has also accused Russia of attacking civilian targets ruthlessly – saying Ukraine did not do that. In a later post on X, Merz said: “We will do everything in our power to continue supporting Ukraine. This also means no longer having any range restrictions on the weapons we supply. Ukraine can now also defend itself by attacking military positions in Russia.” The BBC has approached the Chancellery for comment – specifically if this means Germany will supply its long-discussed Taurus missiles to Ukraine. For context: Kyiv has wanted Germany to provide Taurus missiles, which have a range of around 500km (300 miles).According to German media,, external President Zelensky will visit Berlin on Wednesday, but this has not been officially confirmed.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing'What matters now is concrete action, not words' - Ukrainian MPpublished at 16:01 British Summer Time 26 May16:01 BST 26 MayDonald Trump "should act in response to Russia's actions", the chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee says.Oleksandr Merezhnko tells Interfax news agency: "What matters now is not words but concrete action."He adds that "it is important that Trump delivers on his promise" of introducing sanctions against Russia.

In their place, a pattern continues. Ukraine has been subjected to Washington’s punishments for not falling into line, while Trump has made no public calls for concessions from Putin as part of his ceasefire plan. The White House rejects claims of weakness, pointing out that all the Biden-era sanctions remain in place against Moscow. But the fact remains that Trump’s mediation appears to have made Moscow more, not less, empowered since making contact back in February.Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have negotiated down Trump’s demands and upped their own. In addition to the long list of demands to stop the war, including a ban on Nato membership, they have added that Ukraine cede parts of its own country not even occupied by Russia and that the US formally recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, calls these a “poison pill” introduced by the Kremlin, creating conditions for a ceasefire Kyiv could never accept to shift the blame for it failing onto Ukraine, in Trump’s eyes.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingGrowing fatigue in Ukraine, as war grinds onpublished at 15:15 British Summer Time 26 May15:15 BST 26 MayJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent in KyivIn Kyiv, it is routine for the sirens to sound from the late evening and throughout the night. What’s different now is the length of time between them sounding off and the subsequent explosions. Whether drones are intercepted or hit their targets, the powerful thuds are identical. Over this weekend, when almost 1,000 drones were launched at Ukraine, there tended to be an order to the sounds as well: sirens - bursts of machine gun fire - the whirring sounds of their engines - and then explosions. People you speak to are mostly tired from sleepless nights and the broader weight of Russia’s aggression.Alongside its army’s advances, Moscow also wants to lessen Ukraine's appetite to fight, as well as weaken its position for the eventual ceasefire talks. What Ukraine wants is for Russia to feel the same pain it feels on a daily basis, but it believes it needs the help of the West and additional sanctions to do that.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWestern allies no longer imposing range limits on arms to Ukraine, Merz sayspublished at 14:56 British Summer Time 26 May14:56 BST 26 MayImage source, EPAGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz says Western allies will no longer be imposing range limits on arms delivered to Ukraine.Kyiv previously argued that not being allowed to use long-range weapons inside Russia was like being asked to fight with one hand tied behind its back.In April last year, Ukraine used longer-range ballistic missiles called Atcams - supplied by the US - for the first time.The German chancellor's announcement comes after earlier reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet Merz in Berlin on Wednesday.

It suggests a determination not to antagonise the US president, from whose rhetoric and actions Moscow has repeatedly benefitted.Reasons for trying to keep Donald Trump interested in listening to Vladimir Putin may include dragging out the peace talks while attacking Ukraine, as well as a fear that he may finally make good on his threats to impose new sanctions.Either way, while Moscow has called Volodymyr Zelensky a “clown” and a “loser”, it feels compelled to choose its words carefully when it comes to the notoriously short-tempered US leader.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingMacron says Trump realises Putin has 'lied' about Ukrainepublished at 12:30 British Summer Time 26 May12:30 BST 26 MayImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emmanuel Macron speaks to journalists before attending a state dinner in HanoiFrench President Emmanuel Macron has commented following US President Donald Trump's latest rebuke of the Russian president.During a trip to Vietnam, he tell reporters Trump "realises" Putin has "lied" to him on the war in Ukraine.He adds that he hopes Trump's anger at Putin will "translate into action".Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingFinland summons Russian ambassador over 'airspace violations'published at 12:12 British Summer Time 26 May12:12 BST 26 MayImage source, Getty ImagesFinland's foreign ministry says it has summoned Russia's ambassador to explain a "suspected violation" of the country's airspace.

The only way to make Moscow move faster is through sanctions and weapons," Andriy Yermak says in a post on X. Last week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal.Trump said he believed the call had gone "very well", adding that Russia and Ukraine would "immediately start" negotiations toward a ceasefire and "an end to the war".Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire.

Here's a recap:Trump steps up criticism of 'absolutely crazy' Putin:
      Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin "absolutely CRAZY" after a weekend of major Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine 
    
      "I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him," he said on Sunday
    
      But as Trump's patience wore thin, the Kremlin took a more diplomatic approach
    
      "This is a very important moment which is connected to an emotional overload of everyone involved," spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in response to a question from the BBC
    
      Peskov also expressed Moscow's gratitude to the US for its efforts towards negotiations with Ukraine
    
      At the same time as criticising Putin, Trump also accused Volodymyr Zelensky  of "doing his country no favours by talking the way he does"
    
      The Ukrainian president has not addressed Trump's accusation directly, but  this morning called for more "real pressure" on Russia
    Meanwhile, the attacks continue:
      Last night, Russia fired 355 drones and nine missiles at Ukraine - the Ukrainian air force said it was a record number of drones launched in a single night
    
      Russia said it intercepted 96 Ukrainian drones across 12 regions overnight, including six over Moscow

As we reported earlier on, Donald Trump had stern words for Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader called for more action on sanctions - telling him that he had "better stop".Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingprevious pagePage 1 of 212next pageHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright © 2025 BBC.
