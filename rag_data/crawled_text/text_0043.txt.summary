Suzanne Collins' *Sunrise on the Reaping* is a prequel to *The Hunger Games*, recounting the 50th annual games and highlighting the 16th birthday of Haymitch Abernathy, who wins the competition. The book explores themes of propaganda, censorship, and rebellion, drawing parallels to current U.S. political climate. It includes details about rebel plots, tribute deaths, and District alliances, which were previously omitted from the original series. Collins' commentary on history and power is evident, with the novel questioning how much we know of our past and the role of memory. The book is praised for its unearthing of rebellion and the power of fear in shaping history. It is a critical reflection on the Capitol's control and the importance of truth.
