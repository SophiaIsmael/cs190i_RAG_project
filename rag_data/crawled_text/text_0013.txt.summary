The global ocean set a new record in 2024 with the highest average temperatures, surpassing 2023 and continuing a long-term trend of warming. The study, published in *Advances in Atmospheric Sciences*, highlights that ocean temperatures, particularly the global sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean heat content (OHC), reached record highs. The warming is linked to climate change, contributing to sea-level rise, extreme weather, and marine ecosystem stress. El Ni√±o, which affected the Pacific Ocean, played a role in the temperature rise. The study emphasizes that ocean warming is not just an effect but also a cause of climate change, with potential tipping points. Researchers warn of significant ecological and societal impacts. The findings align with decades of warming trends, and while some metrics show the ocean as a key indicator of climate health, others highlight the complexity of climate signals. The study underscores the urgent need for action to mitigate the impacts of ocean warming.
