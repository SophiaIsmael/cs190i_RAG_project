SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — A one-hit complete-game shutout thrown by UC Santa Barbara sophomore right-hander Jackson Flora knocked Cal Poly out of first place in the Big West Conference baseball standings for the first time this season.

UC Santa Barbara scored four times in the first three innings and that was more than enough for Flora, who improved to 4-2 on the year by throwing 124 pitches in the 4-0 Gaucho victory Saturday afternoon at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium.

Flora struck out nine and the lone hit he allowed was a comebacker off the bat of Mustang shortstop Nate Castellon that caromed off Flora's glove for an infield single in the fifth inning. Flora retired the side in order six times and gave up just one walk while hitting one batter.

The loss dropped Cal Poly out of first place in the Big West standings for the first time this season. The Mustangs, 27-11 overall, are 15-3 in conference games, one game behind front-runner UC Irvine (28-9, 16-2), a 5-0 winner over Hawai'i to complete a series sweep.

Cal Poly, which hosts UC Irvine next weekend inside Baggett Stadium, essentially had just one look at the game Saturday, loading the bases with one out in the fourth inning on a hit batsman, error and walk after Flora had retired the first nine Mustang batters he faced. Center fielder Casey Murray Jr. struck out and left fielder Cam Hoiland's bouncer back to the mound ended the threat.

A sacrifice fly by catcher Nate Vargas gave UCSB a 1-0 lead in the first inning and a wild pitch made it 2-0 in the second. Vargas belted his third home run of the year, a two-run shot to center field in the third inning, to complete the scoring.

Mustang starter Ethan Marmie (4-3) suffered the loss, allowing four runs and five hits over 3 1/3 innings with three walks and a pair of strikeouts. Senior right-hander Tanner Sagouspe shut the door on the Gauchos with his longest outing on the mound as a Mustang, giving up one hit with one walk and three strikeouts over 4 2/3 scoreless frames.

Third baseman Alejandro Garza saw his 20-game hitting streak, sixth-longest in program history, come to an end as he went 0-for-4 at the plate.

Cal Poly, which struck out 34 times in the three-game series and lost a Big West set for the first time this season, was shut out for the second time this year. The other was a 16-0 setback at UCLA in the third game of the season.

Before the weekend series against UC Irvine, Cal Poly will host Fresno State in a 5 p.m. midweek game Tuesday.Print Friendly Version
