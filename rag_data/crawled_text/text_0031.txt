    Trump insults ‘decrepit corpse’ Biden days after cancer diagnosis

New York Daily News 
President Donald Trump’s derogatory swipes against his predecessor Joe Biden continued with a repost calling the ailing Democrat a “decrepit corpse.”The latest attack comes a week after Trump wished his predecessor a “fast and successful recovery” from aggressive stage 4 prostate cancer. It took the form of the current president reposting a message from a MAGA influencer on Truth Social, alleging that Democrats “stole the 2020 election and hijacked the country using a decrepit corpse as a frontman.”There remains no credible evidence of corruption in the 2020 election in which Biden trounced Trump. The “corpse” repost was shared  Monday. Screenshots of it flooded the internet.Biden, 82, announced on May 18 that he and his family were reviewing options to treat his illness. Trump seemed to put his personal feelings behind him until Memorial Day, when he started the morning with a social media message calling his political rivals “scum” and singling Biden out as “incompetent.”

Trump, who turns 79 in June, has repeatedly blamed the previous administration for the challenges he’s faced since winning the 2024 election against Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris.Biden, who didn’t address the personal attacks, recognized the holiday in a message posted his Facebook page.“On Memorial Day, let us pause to remember and honor the brave women and men who made the ultimate sacrifice so we could live our lives in peace and possibility,” the message read. “Today we also honor the families they left behind whose hearts still carry the weight of absence.”_____
