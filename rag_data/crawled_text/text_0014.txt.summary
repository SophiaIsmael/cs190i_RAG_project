Temu's Chinese owner, PDD Holdings, reported a 47% drop in profit for the first quarter, primarily due to the US-China trade war and tariff policies. The US government ended the "de minimis" exemption, making imports under $800 subject to duties, impacting Temu's operations in the US. This led to a 13% decline in US-listed shares. In China, PDD faces a price war with rivals like Alibaba and JD.com due to weak consumer spending. Temu and Shein previously benefited from duty-free sales to the US but now face 120% tariffs. The EU and UK are also dealing with new customs fees for small packages. Despite a thaw in trade tensions, the tariff rate on small packages was slashed by half for 90 days. The US continues to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, and the UK is reviewing customs treatment of low-value products. The document highlights the impact of trade policies on e-commerce and the challenges faced by Chinese companies in the global market.
