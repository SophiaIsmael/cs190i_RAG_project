MIT has closed its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) office and ended programs amid President Sally Kornbluth's decision to shift focus to merit-based hiring. This follows a ban on diversity statements in faculty hiring and student admissions, part of a broader effort to prioritize talent over diversity. The move comes as part of a legal battle with Harvard, which has refused to eliminate DEI programs and lost $3 billion in federal funding. Trump's administration has also cut NIH and DOE grants for research, affecting MIT's budget. Kornbluth, a former college president, has faced criticism for allowing antisemitic harassment, but she defended the need to protect speech and diversity. The decision reflects a broader political and institutional shift against DEI initiatives.
