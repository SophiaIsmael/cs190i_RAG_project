Pope Leo XIV, upon taking office, prioritizes addressing the Church's financial crisis, clerical abuse, and the reform of the Roman Curia. His first meeting was with disgraced Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who was sentenced to prison for financial crimes. He also met with Cardinal Robert Sarah, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Divine Worship, to mend fences. Leo's first official audience was with American Cardinal Se√°n O'Malley, emphasizing the abuse crisis, especially given his experience with the Sodalitium Christiane Vitae (SCV). He met with officials involved in the Jubilee of Hope and Opus Dei, and discussed the reform of Opus Dei's statutes. Leo also met with prefects of the Roman Curia, including Sister Smerilli and Cardinal Czerny, to assess the Church's financial situation. His meetings reflect a focus on continuity with Pope Francis's initiatives, including women in the Church, while addressing unresolved issues from the Francis papacy.
