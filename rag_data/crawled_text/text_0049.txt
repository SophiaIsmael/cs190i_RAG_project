Seven teams that were in last week’s Top 25—Coastal Carolina, Oregon, Vanderbilt, Oregon State, Clemson, Southern Miss and UTSA—strung together perfect weeks. Troy and West Virginia were the only teams that failed to produce a win.
West Virginia, NC State and Louisville dropped from the rankings after the final week of the regular season and were replaced by Georgia Tech, Kansas and Northeastern. Northeastern is making its Top 25 debut while Georgia Tech and Kansas return to the mix for the first time since Weeks 11 and 12, respectively.

6 College Pitchers Who Boosted Their Draft Stock

Upcoming
May 23: SEC Tournament
LSU concluded its regular season with a road series win at South Carolina. The Tigers dropped the series-opener in walk-off fashion, though they bounced back with consecutive victories to seal the series. Kade Anderson (6.2 IP, 4 H, 1 ER, 3 BB, 9 K) and Anthony Eyanson (7 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 3 BB, 5 K) both turned in a pair of quality starts, while slugger Jared Jones blasted four home runs. Jay Johnson’s club was well-rounded on both sides of the ball this season. Five different hitters drove in at least 40 runs and Anderson and Eyanson form one of the most formidable rotation duos in the country. LSU begins SEC Tournament play this Friday, where it will look to cement its top-eight national seed status.
2. North Carolina

Upcoming
May 23: ACC Tournament
North Carolina put a bow on its regular season with a convincing series win over then-No. 5 Florida State. A complete-game effort from Jake Knapp (9 IP, 4 H, 3 ER, 0 BB, 7 K) helped the Tar Heels cruise to an 8-3 win on Thursday before an offensive explosion propelled them to a series-clinching, run-rule victory. North Carolina’s offensive quartet of Hunter Stokely (53), Gavin Gallaher (53), Luke Stevenson (47) and Jackson Van De Brake (45) have combined to drive in 198 runs. A veteran righthander, Knapp has pitched his way to an 11-0 record and a 2.14 ERA, while the freshman bullpen duo of Ryan Lynch and Walker McDuffie have been excellent in relief. North Carolina is the No. 3 seed and earned a double-bye in this week’s ACC tournament.
3. Georgia
Previous ranking: No. 4Last week: 2-1Overall: 42-14, 18-12 in SEC (14-12 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 11-3

Upcoming
May 21: SEC Tournament
It wasn’t easy, but Georgia fended off Texas A&M and polished off its regular-season with a solid series win. The Bulldogs on Thursday overcame a fast start by the Aggies, while in Saturday’s rubber game they scored three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to take the lead for good. Georgia’s veteran-clad lineup has seen multiple hitters enjoy career years, including Robbie Burnett, Ryland Zaborowski and Slate Alford. On the bump, dynamic righthander Brian Curley has been a revelation, while a handful of bullpen arms have emerged as reliable options as postseason play commences. The Bulldogs this Wednesday take on either Kentucky or Oklahoma.
4. Arkansas
Previous ranking: No. 7Last week: 2-1Overall: 43-12, 20-10 in SEC (14-6 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 10-4

Upcoming
May 23: SEC Tournament
Arkansas dropped the opening game of its series against then-No. 18 Tennessee, but it rallied to win back-to-back games and heads into the SEC Tournament with plenty of momentum. In what’s been the case all season, the Razorbacks received meaningful contributions from nearly all of their starting nine—led by Ryder Helfrick who drove in seven runs—and a handful of lights-out performances on the mound. Arkansas has no shortage of depth on both sides of the baseball. Five different Razorbacks hitters drove in at least 50 runs, while its 4.12 team ERA ranks inside the top 25 nationally and its 20 SEC wins are tied for the second-most in the Dave Van Horn era. Comfortably a top-eight national seed, Arkansas this Friday begins SEC Tournament play.
5. Texas
Previous ranking: No. 6Last week: 2-1Overall: 42-11, 22-8 in SEC (11-6 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 12-2

Upcoming
May 22: SEC Tournament
Texas wrapped up its regular-season with a rivalry series win at Oklahoma. Thursday’s series-opening victory was special: star outfielder Max Belyeu made his return to the lineup and blasted the game-winning, three-run home run to help the Longhorns—in their first year as a member of the conference—secured the regular-season SEC title. Despite dealing with a fair share of injuries, every Texas hitter at one point or another has delivered a memorable swing, while its pitching staff has been fantastic week in and week out. Texas begins SEC Tournament play this Thursday, though it has already locked up a top-eight national seed and is squarely in contention to be the No. 1 overall seed.
6. Oregon
Previous ranking: No. 9Last week: 3-0Overall: 41-13, 22-8 in Big Ten (6-1 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 13-1

Upcoming
May 22: Big Ten Tournament: Michigan StateMay 23: Big Ten Tournament: Nebraska
Oregon wrapped up its regular-season slate with a dominant road series victory at Iowa to clinch a share of the Big Ten regular-season title. The Ducks’ first season in the conference was a resounding success. Their 41 wins are already the most in a single-season since 2014, while its 22 conference wins are the most in a single-season since Oregon reinstated its program in 2009. The Ducks offense has been led by Player of the Year candidate Mason Neville—whose 26 home runs lead the country—and lefty slugger Jacob Walsh, who’s in the midst of a career-year of his own. In addition to a bevy of reliable bullpen arms, Oregon’s rotation is anchored by southpaw Grayson Grinsell. Not only have the Ducks established themselves as a host, but a deep run in the Big Ten Tournament could propel them to a top-eight national seed.
7. Auburn
Previous ranking: No. 2Last week: 2-2Overall: 38-17, 17-13 in SEC (15-12 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 11-3
Results

Upcoming
May 21: SEC Tournament
Auburn finished its regular season with a series loss at then-No. 22 Ole Miss, but it’s still been a season to remember for the Tigers. After going an underwhelming 27-26 (8-22 in SEC) in 2024, they’ve done a complete 180. Their 38 wins are tied for the second-most in a single-season since 2018, while their 17 SEC wins are tied for the most since 2010. Lefthanded sluggers Cooper McMurray (57) and Ike Irish (52) have combined to drive in 109 RBIs, while star freshman Chris Rembert has been the team’s leading hitter to the tune of a .355/.485/.590 slash line. On the mound, Samuel Dutton has been a revelation and has collected 89 strikeouts across 75.1 innings. Auburn heads into the SEC Tournament as a comfortable host, though a win or two could seal a coveted top-eight national seed. 
8. Coastal Carolina
Previous ranking: No. 8Last week: 3-0Overall: 44-11, 26-4 in Sun Belt (3-2 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 13-1
Results
May 15: @ Old Dominion; W 6-3 May 16: @ Old Dominion; W 16-7May 17: @ Old Dominion; W 12-1 (7)
Upcoming
May 21: Sun Belt Tournament
This weekend’s sweep of Old Dominion served as an exclamation point on a historic season for Coastal Carolina. Its 26 conference wins are the most in program history, while its 44 wins are the second-most in a single-season since 2010. Kevin Schnall has done a remarkable job in his first year at the helm and is in the mix to take home national Coach of the Year honors. The Chanticleers are typically a team built on their offense, but this year their pitching has taken a major step forward. Their 3.31 team ERA ranks third nationally and the pitching staff has been led by 6-foot-8 righthander Jacob Morrison, whose 1.95 ERA also ranks third nationally. Coastal Carolina is comfortably a host, though a Sun Belt Tournament championship could net it a top-eight national seed.
9. Florida State
Previous ranking: No. 5Last week: 1-2Overall: 37-13, 17-10 in ACC (6-8 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 10-3
Results
May 15: No. 3 North Carolina; L 8-3May 16: No. 3 North Carolina; L 11-1 (7)May 17: No. 3 North Carolina; W 5-4
Upcoming
May 23: ACC Tournament
A series loss knocked Florida State out of the ACC regular season title race, but the Seminoles ended on a high note with a dramatic walk-off win. Year three under head coach Link Jarrett has been a clear success, with the team poised to surpass last season’s 17 conference wins and potentially eclipse the 40-win mark for the second consecutive year. At the front of the rotation, projected top-five overall pick Jamie Arnold has delivered once again, anchoring the staff with dominant consistency. On the other side of the ball, shortstop Alex Lodise has emerged as a breakout star and legitimate National Player of the Year candidate. While Florida State likely sits just outside the top-eight national seed line, it is firmly in position to host a regional this June.
10. Vanderbilt
Previous ranking: No. 10Last week: 3-0Overall: 39-16, 19-11 in SEC (10-10 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 9-5
Results
May 15: Kentucky; W 8-7May 16: Kentucky; W 9-8May 17: Kentucky; W 5-3
Upcoming
May 22: SEC Tournament
There was no shortage of excitement in Vanderbilt’s last regular-season series, as it earned a trio of come-from-behind victories, including back-to-back walk-off wins, en route to a sweep. Braden Holcomb and veteran shortstop Jonathan Vastine belted walk-off home runs on consecutive days, while Connor Fennell in the finale slammed the door with five strikeouts in as many shutout innings. This year has been a bit of a bounceback campaign for the Commodores, who last year finished 38-23 overall and 13-17 in the SEC. Their 19 conference wins this season match their second-highest total since 2015 and they head into conference tournament week as a comfortable top-eight national seed.
11. Oregon State
Previous ranking: No. 11Last week: 4-0Overall: 41-12-1 (5-5 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 11-3
Results
May 13: Portland; W 5-3May 15: Long Beach State; W 2-1May 16: Long Beach State; W 12-8 May 17: Long Beach State; W 13-0 (7)
Upcoming
May 30: NCAA Tournament
Oregon State put the cherry on top of its regular-season with a perfect week that was headlined by a sweep of Long Beach State. Coach Mitch Canham’s crew didn’t miss a beat as an independent and crossed the 40-win threshold for the fourth-straight season. Potential top-five overall pick Aiva Arquette led the team in average (.348), home runs (17) and RBIs (60), while toolsy outfielder Gavin Turley has also enjoyed a career-year to the tune of a .338/.465/.622 slash line with 27 extra-base hits and 57 RBIs. The Beavers not only have a host of reliable bullpen arms, but the duo of star freshman Dax Whitney and Ethan Kleinschmit are a dynamic one-two punch atop the rotation. Oregon State will certainly host this June, the only question is whether or not it will be a top-eight national seed. With an RPI of 6 and 20 Q1+Q2 wins, the Beavers certainly have a compelling case.
12. Florida
Previous ranking: No. 13Last week: 2-1Overall: 37-19, 15-15 in SEC (9-15 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 10-4

May 20: SEC Tournament: South Carolina
Florida in early April looked dead in the water at just 1-11 in SEC play. Then it went on an incredible run to end the regular-season and won each of its last six series to finish with 15 conference wins. The Gators have been arguably the most injury-riddled team in the country, yet week in and week out they’ve continued to find ways to win. Senior Bobby Boser has been a steady presence in the lineup all season, and his 58 RBIs lead the team. On the hill, Florida boasts the imposing duo of blue chip freshman Aidan King and star sophomore Liam Peterson. While this weekend’s series win over Alabama was another feather in its cap, Florida likely needs at least one win this week in Hoover to push itself onto the right side of the hosting bubble.
13. Dallas Baptist
Previous ranking: No. 15Last week: 2-1Overall: 38-14, 21-6 in Conference USA (3-1 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 13-1
Results
May 15: @ Liberty; W 6-4May 16: @ Liberty; L 7-6May 17: @ Liberty; W 6-0
Upcoming
May 21: Conference USA Tournament
Dallas Baptist never looked back after a disappointing early April series loss to Western Kentucky, reeling off six consecutive series wins to close out the regular season and secure its fifth league title under coach Dan Heefner. The Patriots’ push for the crown was a true team effort, with six of the 10 players who logged at least 20 appearances batting over .300. Power production also came in bunches as Grant Jay (19), Nathan Humphreys (17), Chayton Krauss (13) and Jake Bennett (12) all reached double-digit home runs. On the mound, a steady weekend rotation formed around righthanders Ryan Borberg (3.42 ERA in 68.1 innings), James Ellwanger (4.08 ERA in 53 innings) and Micah Bucknam (4.61 ERA in 56.2 innings). In the bullpen, lefthander Mason Peters (3.82 ERA, 50 strikeouts to 14 walks, four saves in 35.1 innings) provided a dependable late-game option. Already a lock for an NCAA Tournament at-large bid, Dallas Baptist enters the Conference USA Tournament playing with house money. It will open against Liberty on Wednesday.
14. Clemson
Previous ranking: No. 17Last week: 3-0Overall: 41-15, 18-12 in ACC (6-5 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 11-3
Results
May 15: @ Pittsburgh; W 6-1May 16: @ Pittsburgh; W 11-2May 17: @ Pittsburgh; W 13-6
Upcoming
May 21: ACC Tournament
Clemson hasn’t played a postseason game yet, but it already sits just three wins shy of matching its highest total under head coach Erik Bakich, who posted 44-win seasons in each of his first two years at the helm. The Tigers reached the 40-win mark with a road sweep of Pitt, a series that opened with a combined no-hitter sparked by ace Aidan Knaak, who tossed 7.1 innings and matched a career high with 12 strikeouts. Clemson appears built for another deep postseason push, boasting the kind of balance that plays in the summer. Jacob Jarrell, Collin Priest and Josh Paino each reached double-digit home runs, while Cam Cannarella hit .332 and played standout defense in center field. On the mound, Knaak, Drew Titsworth and a steady bullpen trio of Lucas Mahlstedt, Joe Allen and Reed Garris provided consistency from start to finish. The ACC Tournament is up next for Clemson and while it may not drastically affect the Tigers’ postseason positioning, a deep run could still nudge them upward.
15. UCLA
Previous ranking: No. 20Last week: 2-1Overall: 39-15, 22-8 in Big Ten (2-4 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 12-2
Results
May 15: Northwestern; L 9-4May 16: Northwestern; W 8-2May 17: Northwestern; W 11-1 (7)
Upcoming
May 21: Big Ten Tournament
After missing the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back seasons for the first time in his 20-year tenure, John Savage entered 2025 confident that UCLA’s blend of seasoned, homegrown talent and key transfer additions would return the program to national relevance. He was right. With a series win over Northwestern to close the regular season, the Bruins clinched a share of the Big Ten title—alongside fellow newcomer Oregon—for their first conference crown since 2019. That resurgence was fueled by a potent offensive core, as Roch Cholowsky, Mulivai Levu and AJ Salgado combined for 43 home runs, led by Cholowsky’s 20. Now in a hosting position, UCLA heads into the Big Ten Tournament with a chance to solidify its NCAA Tournament resume even further.
16. Ole Miss
Previous ranking: No. 22Last week: 3-1Overall: 34-17, 14-13 in SEC (9-9 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 8-5

May 13: UT Martin; W 11-5May 15: No. 2 Auburn; W 9-2May 16: No. 2 Auburn; W 15-11May 17: No. 2 Auburn; L 13-8
Upcoming
May 21: SEC Tournament
After a brutal five-week stretch that included four series losses—three of them to teams that are currently unranked—Ole Miss appeared to be slipping out of the hosting conversation entirely. But the Rebels stabilized just in time, closing the regular season with two wins over then-No. 2 Auburn to vault back into the top 16 picture and push their RPI up to No. 18. There’s still work to do to lock down a regional host spot, but the opportunity is now squarely in front of them with the SEC Tournament looming as a critical proving ground. Among others, ace Hunter Elliott, who fired seven scoreless frames with eight strikeouts against Auburn, will have to continue to produce at a high clip for postseason baseball to return to Oxford for the first time since 2021.
17. Southern Miss
Previous ranking: No. 24Last week: 3-0Overall: 41-13, 24-6 in Sun Belt (7-3 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 13-1

Upcoming
May 21: Sun Belt Tournament
With the No. 70 strength of schedule and limited high-end opportunities, Southern Miss hadn’t had many chances to prove itself—until the final weekend. Facing a top-15 Troy team on the road, the Golden Eagles passed one of their biggest weekend tests of the season with a statement sweep, extending their winning streak to 15 games and vaulting seven spots in the rankings. Second-year head coach Christian Ostrander leads a team built for a deep run, with bona fide ace JB Middleton (2.07 ERA, 104 strikeouts, 23 walks in 91.1 innings) and a power-packed lineup paced by Nick Monistere, Matthew Russo and Carson Paetow. Southern Miss has reached the College World Series just once in its history, but this group has the depth and momentum to make another run a real possibility.
18. Alabama
Previous ranking: No. 16Last week: 1-2Overall: 40-15, 16-14 in SEC (13-12 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 8-6

Upcoming
May 20: SEC Tournament
Alabama couldn’t carry over the momentum from its series win over then-No. 1 Georgia, dropping two of three at Florida to close the regular season. Still, it capped an undeniably strong campaign—topping 40 wins and finishing 16-14 in SEC play while navigating the nation’s No. 16 strength of schedule. Offensively, Justin Lebron and Kade Snell paced a consistent lineup, while Riley Quick, Braylon Myers and Carson Ozmer led the charge on the mound. The Crimson Tide sit on the hosting bubble and will need a strong showing in Hoover to secure a top-16 seed.
19. Georgia Tech

Upcoming
May 22: ACC Tournament
Georgia Tech’s seven-game skid in mid-April now feels like a distant memory. Since then, Danny Hall’s Yellow Jackets have won 10 of their final 12 games to clinch their first outright ACC title since 2005 (and first of any kind since 2011). It’s a fitting late-season surge for the legendary Hall, who is in the final chapter of a career that includes over 1,000 wins and the only three College World Series appearances in program history. A storybook ending would mean a fourth trip to Omaha—and this group looks capable of at least making that dream plausible.
20. UTSA

Upcoming
May 20: AAC Tournament
UTSA hasn’t even played a postseason game yet, but Pat Hallmark has already orchestrated the greatest season in program history. The Roadrunners eclipsed 40 wins for the first time ever and have all but secured an at-large bid, regardless of their performance in the AAC Tournament, which begins Tuesday against the same Rice team they just swept. UTSA has dropped just five games since March 18 and enters the postseason as one of the hottest—and most underappreciated—teams in the country.
21. Kansas

Upcoming
May 22: Big 12 Tournament
Much like UTSA’s Hallmark, Kansas coach Dan Fitzgerald has already made a compelling case for having led the best season in program history. Kansas’ sweep of then-No. 19 West Virginia to close the regular season locked in program records for both overall regular-season and conference wins. Built heavily through the transfer portal and junior college ranks, the Jayhawks have ridden their veteran-laden roster to one of the nation’s most explosive offenses and a quietly effective pitching staff. Now firmly on the hosting bubble, Kansas has a real shot at securing a top-16 seed with one or two wins in the Big 12 Tournament—especially if results elsewhere break in its favor.
22. UC Irvine
Previous ranking: No. 12Last week: 1-2Overall: 39-13, 24-6 in Big West (2-3 vs. Top 25)Weekend record: 11-3

Upcoming
May 22: Big West Tournament
What once looked like a top-eight national seed trajectory has unraveled into a likely No. 2 seed in someone else’s regional. UC Irvine’s late-season slide continued with a home series loss to Cal State Fullerton, following a damaging series defeat at UC San Diego two weeks prior. The Anteaters now own seven combined Quad-III and IIII losses—an unsustainable number for any team, let alone a Big West program with zero margin for error. Still, this is a group with enough talent to be dangerous in the postseason. Colin Yeaman, Jacob McCombs, Anthony Martinez, Ricky Ojeda and Blake Penso, among others, remain key pieces capable of sparking a turnaround in the Big West Tournament and beyond.
23. Tennessee

Upcoming
May 21: SEC Tournament
No late-season slide has been more surprising than Tennessee’s. Once the longest-standing No. 1 team in the country, the Volunteers have now lost six of their final seven series, limping into the postseason and clinging to a spot in the Top 25. Despite a solid RPI (No. 16), 41 total wins and 12 Quad I victories, their recent form makes a regional host bid unlikely without a strong showing in Hoover. Momentum matters in college baseball’s selection process and Tony Vitello’s team just doesn’t have any right now. The talent is there in abundance to turn things around fast, though.

If strength of schedule is set aside, few teams in the country can match what Northeastern accomplished this season. The Huskies racked up 45 wins—24 of them consecutively—while posting the nation’s best team ERA and a top-quartile offense in total scoring. Yes, the schedule strength (No. 182) falls well below that of any other Top 25 team, and they’ve yet to face a ranked opponent, but this group has done everything it could with the slate it was given. With a deep, balanced roster and dominant pitching, Northeastern looks every bit the part of a dangerous No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
25. Troy

Upcoming
May 21: Sun Belt Tournament
Troy was the only Division I team to go 13 weeks without dropping a weekend series this season, a feat made possible largely by capitalizing on a manageable schedule that included just a few ranked matchups and one mid-March series against Coastal Carolina. But when finally tested at home by then-No. 24 Southern Miss, the Trojans were overmatched and swept, casting real doubt on their postseason standing. Now sitting at No. 44 in the RPI and just 3-8 in Quadrant I games, Troy looks like a bubble-in three-seed with a razor-thin margin. Its opener against Old Dominion in the Sun Belt Tournament is pivotal—lose that, and the Trojans could be on the outside looking in come Selection Monday.
