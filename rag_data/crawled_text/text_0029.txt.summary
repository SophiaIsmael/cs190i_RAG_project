Harvard University renamed its DEI office to "Community and Campus Life" following a legal battle with the Trump administration over federal funding. The move comes as the administration continues to pressure universities to adopt policies that prioritize political ideology over diversity. Harvard, which had sued the administration over a $2.2 billion funding freeze, announced it would stop hosting graduation celebrations that could separate students based on race. The administration has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and restrict foreign student admissions. The university's leadership, including President Alan Garber, emphasized that they would not surrender their independence. The renaming reflects a shift in the office's focus from DEI to fostering inclusivity and community. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between academic freedom and government demands, with the administration accusing Harvard of engaging in "illegal and immoral discrimination." The legal battle continues, with Harvard seeking to uphold its constitutional rights and independence.
