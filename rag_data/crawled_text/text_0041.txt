Back in June 2024, Scholastic announced that Suzanne Collins would be releasing her fifth book in the series Sunrise on the Reaping. And that very same day, Lionsgate announced that the prequel—which is set 24 years prior to the OG book The Hunger Games and begins on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Games—would be turned into a movie.  "With Sunrise on the Reaping, I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,'" Suzanne shared in a press release at the time. "The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question 'Real or not real?' seems more pressing to me every day."Also pressing? When the book and movie would be released. While the novel debuted in March (you can read more about it here), fans have to wait longer for the film—like, a lot longer, as it doesn’t hit theaters until November 2026.photos20 Secrets About The Hunger Games RevealedPerhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that the studio would want to make a sixth movie. After all, Lionsgate stated in a recent press release that the first five films raked in more than $3.3 billion at the box office. Part of the draw of these films was the star-studded cast. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland were among the big names to appear in the first four films: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay part one and part two. And for the fifth film, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth, Viola Davis and Hunter Schafer were among the celebrities to join the franchise.Several stars have also volunteered as tribute to appear in Sunrise on the Reaping, including Kieran Culkin, Elle Fanning, Ralph Fiennes, Maya Hawke, Jesse Plemons, Mckenna Grace, Whitney Peak and Joseph Zada.For a breakdown of everything we know about the movie The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping so far, keep reading.LionsgateWhen Does The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping Hit Theaters?A little birdie, er mockingjay, revealed the movie will be released November 20, 2026.Scholastic PressWhat Is The Hunger Games Book Sunrise on the Reaping About?This book is a prequel to The Hunger Games and takes place 24 years prior to when readers first met Katniss Everdeen.The story opens on the morning of the reaping (the event where tributes from each district are chosen to compete) of the 50th Hunger Games (a.k.a. the Second Quarter Quell)."As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem," the description on author Suzanne Collins' website reads.
