Harvard University President Alan Garber addressed the Trump administration's attempts to cut research funding and restrict international student enrollment, arguing these actions are retaliatory and undermine the university's commitment to public benefit. The administration froze over $2 billion in grants and sought to revoke international student enrollment rights, prompting Harvard to sue. Garber emphasized that research funding is critical for high-priority national work and that freezing it harms both Harvard and the country. He criticized the administration for focusing on antisemitism and viewpoint diversity while ignoring the broader impact of funding cuts. Harvard maintains that international students contribute significantly to its academic and cultural environment. The administration has also accused Harvard of not complying with requests about international student information, leading to legal battles. Garber stressed the importance of free speech and open discourse, noting that international students enable diverse perspectives and academic growth. He warned that such actions could set a precedent for other universities and highlight the need for accountability in federal funding.
