The document reviews Suzanne Collins' new Hunger Games prequel, *Sunrise on the Reaping*, focusing on Haymitch Abernathy's origin story and the second Quarter Quell. Collins explores Haymitch's evolution from an innocent sixteen-year-old to a cynical alcoholic, highlighting the oppressive nature of Panem. The prequel introduces the double tributes in the Quarter Quell and delves into the mechanisms of power and resistance. While some argue it's a cash grab, the review acknowledges Collins' thoughtful approach to character development and the themes of rebellion. The book provides insight into District 12's history and the characters' personal struggles, though it doesn't introduce new plot elements. The review ends by emphasizing the danger of blindly following oppressive systems and the importance of change, as reflected in Lenore Dove's commentary.
