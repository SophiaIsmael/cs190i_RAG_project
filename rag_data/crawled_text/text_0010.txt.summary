The document discusses the accelerated warming of sea surface temperatures, with a 0.27 C per decade increase from 2019 to 2023, four times faster than in the 1980s. This is attributed to greenhouse gas levels, leading to an energy imbalance. The study, published in Environmental Research Letters, uses ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (CCI) data from satellites like ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-3 to analyze long-term trends. The study notes that short-term fluctuations from El Niño, volcanic activity, and solar changes do not alter the long-term warming trend. The findings contribute to ESA’s MOTECUSOMA project, focusing on Earth's energy imbalance and its impact on climate. The data is available via ESA’s CCI portal and Obs4MIPs framework. The document emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and model refinement to accurately predict future climate changes.
