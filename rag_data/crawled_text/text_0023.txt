He texted her to say “congrats” as they are still close friends, he tells the court. Attorneys tried to get through Ventura’s testimony as quickly as possible as she was in her third trimester when she took the stand. So far, it’s more of the same cross-examination of Nash, with lawyer Xavier Donaldson framing Combs as interested in the success of Ventura’s career. He notes that Combs’s record company paid for Ventura’s many hours in the studio, and that her mix tape involved many successful artists including Pusha T and Rick Ross. Court is expected to wrap at about 16:00 local time (21:00 BST) today.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingDeonte Nash's testimony so far - a round uppublished at 20:47 British Summer Time 28 May20:47 BST 28 MayWarning: This post contains distressing details.Stylist Deonte Nash has just finished being questioned by the prosecution. He worked for Combs between 2008 and 2018, and is a friend of his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. If you're just coming to us now, here's a recap of what he's said so far:
      Nash alleges there were multiple incidences in which Combs was violent with him and Ventura
    
      He gave an example of Combs's violence against Ventura, describing how the mogul appeared at her apartment and started allegedly beating her even after her head smashed into a bed frame and started bleeding
    
      He and Ventura hid “too many times to count” because they didn’t want Combs to “attack” them, Nash said
    
      Combs allegedly lodged several threats at Ventura, including threatening to send their sex tapes to their professional contacts, threatening to release so-called "freak-off" videos of her, and threatening her parents
    
      Nash said all of Ventura's outfits for public appearances needed approval from Combs, and recounted a time Combs allegedly lifted him up in the air after disliking the way Ventura's hair had been styled by Nash

He’s delivering curt responses as the defence asks him introductory questions, as well as emphasising how little he wants to be in court today. “I don’t do federal court,” he says, answering a question about why he hired a lawyer. 
He’s also corrected the defence on other things. “You testified about your relationship with Ms Ventura,” the defence attorney says.
“Mrs. Fine,” Nash says, insisting on using the singer’s married name.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCombs's stylist says he 'doesn't hate Combs'published at 20:16 British Summer Time 28 May20:16 BST 28 MaySakshi VenkatramanReporting from courtAs Nash’s direct examination comes to a close, prosecutors ask what kind of relationship the stylist still has with Combs. He says he stopped working for Combs in 2018, the same year Ventura and the mogul broke up. But he tells the court he has exchanged “loving” messages with him since then.  When asked why he would talk lovingly with a man who hurt one of his best friends, he says it’s habit. “This man’s sanity was my safety. It’s just what I was used to.” 
Though he remains close with Ventura, he says he doesn’t hate Combs. “It’s just not in me,” he says.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNash describes how Combs’s assistant was allegedly involvedpublished at 19:55 British Summer Time 28 May19:55 BST 28 MayMadeline HalpertReporting from courtWe are also hearing a lot about how Combs’s assistant Kristina Khorram was allegedly involved in tracking down Ventura and Nash. Nash says Khorram would “call incessantly” - as well as Combs - when Combs was trying to find him and Ventura when they were hiding. Nash says Khorram would tell them she had talked to Combs and calmed him down so it was OK to go talk to him. So then, Ventura would, Nash says. Asked whether the violence continued after that, Nash says yes.Khorram has previously called accusations made against her "horrific" and "false".Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCourt hears Ventura and Nash hid from Diddy, fearing his attackspublished at 19:30 British Summer Time 28 May19:30 BST 28 MayMadeline HalpertReporting from courtImage source, ReutersThis afternoon, prosecutors appear to be trying to boost their racketeering case - the allegation that Combs’s loyal inner circle was involved in a criminal enterprise that sex trafficked women. We’ve heard from Nash about several instances where he and Ventura tried to “hide” from Combs, but his staff called to try to locate them and security guard would escort Combs to come to try to find them.On one instance, Nash says he was leaving a hotel where Ventura had been hiding after Combs allegedly attacked her, and Nash said he noticed one of Combs’s security people following him home. He and Ventura hid “too many times to count” because they didn’t want Combs to “attack” them, Nash says.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCombs threatened to release Ventura's sex tapes, Nash tells courtpublished at 19:23 British Summer Time 28 May19:23 BST 28 MaySakshi VenkatramanReporting from courtNash is recounting another instance of Combs’s alleged violence against Ventura. Around 2013 or 2014, Nash and Ventura were cooking in her apartment when Combs came in, grabbed Cassie by the hair and told both of them to get out of “my house”. He allegedly physically forced them both out the front door and told Nash to go wait downstairs. Security was blocking him from going anywhere once he got downstairs, Nash said. Ventura eventually came down and got in Nash’s car, and the two drove away together. While driving they got a call from Combs telling them to pull over.
Nash says Combs came to the car window and yelled at Ventura, threatening that he would release "freak-off" videos of her. Ventura explained to Nash that the tapes were of her and other men and that she did not want to be having sex with other men, Nash told the court. He says he dropped Ventura off to get a taxi and then went home.Combs then came by his house and searched it, asking “where is she?”
He looked everywhere, Nash said. “He went in the oven, I don’t know why he went in the oven,” Nash said on the stand. Eventually he took Nash’s phone, where he saw a call from the hotel where Ventura was staying. Nash says Combs kept his phone, and along with security, forced him into the car to go and get Ventura.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNash says he saw Combs repeatedly beat Venturapublished at 19:09 British Summer Time 28 May19:09 BST 28 MaySakshi VenkatramanReporting from courtImage source, ReutersWarning: This post contains distressing detailsDeonte Nash is back on the stand after lunch, and he’s telling the court about times he saw Combs get violent with Cassie Ventura. He recalled one incident where he, Ventura and a woman named "Mia" were at Ventura’s Los Angeles apartment. 
Ventura was asleep on the couch, when Nash says Combs showed up at the door. Combs yelled at her and then grabbed her by the hair and started beating her, he tells the court. Nash, "Mia" and Ventura tried to run into a separate bedroom and close the door, but Combs managed to get in and continued to hit Ventura, Nash alleges. Nash and "Mia" both tried to jump on Combs’s back to stop him from hitting Ventura, he said, but were thrown off. 
Nash says Combs continued to hit Ventura even after her head smashed into the corner of the bed frame and blood began pouring from her head. When he saw the blood Combs “freaked out” but Nash says he was instructed not to contact emergency services. Instead, Combs said a security guard would take her to the plastic surgeon. Nash says he saw Ventura on FaceTime the next day with stitches over a gash in her eyebrow."Mia" is a pseudonym. We are expecting to hear from her in court later today.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCourt resumes with Ventura's friend and stylist back on standpublished at 19:03 British Summer Time 28 May19:03 BST 28 MayThe court has returned from a lunch break with stylist Deonte Nash returning to the stand.Before lunch, he told the court how Combs would approve Ventura's outfits and that he saw Combs threaten her multiple times.Stay with us as we bring you the latest from courtShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingListen to the BBC's Diddy on Trial podcastpublished at 18:50 British Summer Time 28 May18:50 BST 28 MayAnoushka Mutanda-DoughertyPodcast host, Diddy on TrialThe BBC's Diddy on Trial podcast has followed every twist and turn in Diddy’s case since November 2024.From bombshell balcony dangling allegations, to featuring in a Kanye West track behind bars, and Diddy accusing the federal government of racism - there have been headline-making moments every week... and that's before the trial even started.Now we're bringing you all the updates straight from court in New York.You can listen to the podcast on BBC Sounds or watch on our YouTube channel, external, external.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingDancer involved in 'freak-offs' apologises to Cassie Venturapublished at 18:24 British Summer Time 28 May18:24 BST 28 MayImage source, ReutersImage caption, Sharay Hayes testified in court on 20 MayAn exotic dancer who was involved in the so-called "freak-offs" with Sean "Diddy" Combs and Cassie Ventura has apologised for his involvement.
