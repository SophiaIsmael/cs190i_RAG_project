The document discusses the 2023 marine heat extreme in the North Atlantic, driven by a combination of internal variability and human-induced climate change. It highlights that the event was unprecedented due to enhanced ocean stratification from anthropogenic warming and multidecadal variability, leading to extreme surface temperature anomalies. The study emphasizes that while the event could not have occurred without human influence, it is considered a decadal event in the North Atlantic and a centennial event in the subtropics. The analysis underscores the role of internal variability in amplifying the impact of climate change, with significant implications for marine ecosystems and climate risk assessment. The study also notes that the event's spatial patterns are critical for future climate risk evaluation, and it calls for improved understanding of internal variability to better predict and manage climate impacts.
